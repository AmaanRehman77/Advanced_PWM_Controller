# Advanced_PWM_Controller

This repository contains the Verilog implementation and testbench for an Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) interfaced Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) controller. The design includes detailed modules for configuring PWM parameters such as period, pulse width, and duty cycle, controlled via an APB interface, making it suitable for various digital signal control applications.

## Features

- **APB Interface**: Provides a robust communication protocol for configuring PWM parameters.
- **Configurable PWM**: Allows dynamic adjustment of PWM period, pulse width, and enable control.
- **SystemVerilog Testbench**: Includes a comprehensive testbench for simulating and verifying the PWM controller functionality. (Incomplete)

## Applications

- Motor Control
- LED Dimming
- Signal Generation
- Power Management
- Embedded Systems
